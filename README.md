## Description
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game.  
**Features:**
- Users can guess letters to figure out a secret word.
- Includes input validation to ensure guesses are alphabetical and single characters.
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined word list.

**Goals of the Project:**
- Learn how to structure a Python program into functions.
- Implement basic validation logic and control flow using loops.
- Explore user interaction through terminal inputs.

**What I Learned:**
- Writing modular Python code using functions.
- Handling errors and invalid inputs gracefully.
- Using Git and GitHub for version control.
