The Hangman Game is a Python-based word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a randomly chosen word by suggesting letters. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses and ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of lives.

Aim of the Project
To implement object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
To practice creating and using classes and methods.
To improve understanding of loops, conditional logic, and user input validation.
Key Learnings
Using Python classes to organize code effectively.
Validating user input to maintain a smooth user experience.
Designing game logic with a focus on functionality and clarity.
Installation Instructions

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your computer.
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/SupremeSparksCleaningCo/Hangman-Game.git
